\details{
bgc_ss_grd is the site series call - right now, this can't be NA (only true for edaphic paper)
beclabel	Concatanation of (BGC_zone + BGC_sbzn + BGC_var), based on provincial BEC coverage if ground sample coordinates available, otherwise ground sample based
beclabel_grd	concatanation of (BGC_zone_grd + BGC_sbzn_grd + BGC_var_grd), ground sample based classification
